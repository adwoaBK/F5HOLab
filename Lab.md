**Pre-requisites**
Before we get started with the exercises there are few environment pre-requisites that will need to be installed and setup.

### Install the Web Application Samples

1. Login to **SHAApp1** VM as **wingtiptoys\administrator**
2. Open Windows PowerShell ISE as Administrator
3. Open the Browser and type `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jeevanbisht/Azure-ActiveDirectory-AppProxy-DemoSuite/master/BootStrap.ps1` in url.
4. Copy the entire script from this URL and paste the contents in previously open powerShell ISE console and execute. This should install the webserver and the sample websites required for the lab.


# **Lab 1: Publish a Header Based Application with F5 BIG IP APM and Azure AD**
##### **Objective** : 
We will publish a Header Based Application running Internally on the SHAAPP1 Web Server. The application can be accessed internally by using http://shaapp1:90/HeaderApp1

Below are the series of steps required.
